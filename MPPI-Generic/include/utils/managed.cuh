/**
* @class Managed managed.cuh
* @brief Class for setting the stream to be used by dynamics and cost functions used
* by MPPIController.
*
* This class has one variable, which is the CUDA stream, and a function which sets the
* stream. It is meant to be inherited by costs and dynamics classes which are passed into
* the MPPIController kernels. In the past, this class used unified memory (hence the managed name),
* so that classes could be passed by reference to CUDA kernels. However, as of right now,
* the difficulties of using unified memory with multi-threaded CPU programs make getting
* good performance with unified memory difficult, so this has been removed. Future implementations
* may bring back the unified memory feature.
